<h1> Overview</h1>

The Cross-Ministry Hiring Project uses one job posting to fill positions across the BC Public Service. Our team supports many hiring managers at one time by managing the hiring process. After the competition ends, we create an Eligibility List with pre-qualified candidates. This list becomes the source for filling other positions.
