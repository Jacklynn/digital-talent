## Time commitements for hiring managers

We have two options for hiring managers: 

### No involvement

This option benefits hiring managers who need talent from CMHP, but cannot take part in the hiring process. Our team provides updates as we progress through each step. For this option, we expect hiring managers to: 
- Attend a consensus meeting to review and approve the draft job posting, job profile and questionnaires.
- Rank preferred candidates based on scored competition notes.
  
### Full Involvement

This option gives hiring managers, or designates, opportunities to take in every step of the hiring process. Because demand to take part can be high, we engage in a selection processes for a hiring panel. In total, hiring managers participating in full involvement will commit <b>10 hours</b>: 
- Attend a consensus meeting to review and approve the job posting, job profile and screening questionnaire.
- Review and screen candidates within three days of receiving the QST report.
- Attend consensus meeting for final decision on screened candidates.
- Review and approve drafts of technical assessments.
- Score technical assessments.
- Three consecutive days for panel interviews.
- Conduct reference checks for successful candidates.
- Attend meeting for collective candidate scoring with panel members.
- Attend meeting for candidate ranking debrief.
