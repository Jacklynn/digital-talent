<h1>Overview</h1>

In 2022, our success in piloting Cross-Ministry Hiring led to the creation of a new service: RapidHire. 

RapidHire prioritizes matching candidates to Agile projects. 

The service closes the gap between current workforce trends and demand for tech talent.  The service focuses on proactive candidate recruitment through a streamlined application process. This service provides candidates within 3 weeks. 
The offer is quick because the candidate receives the new [Qualified Appointment] product.  [Qualified Appointment] is a 1-year auxiliary role, which can be converted to permanent after a successful probation.
