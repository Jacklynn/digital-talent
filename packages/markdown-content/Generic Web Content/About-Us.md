<h1>About The Digital Talent Attraction and Development Team</h1>

On April 6th, 2023, the Digital Office released <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/digital-government/digital-plan.pdf">B.C. Government’s Digital Plan</a>. One of many items reported on are hiring barriers:

<blockquote>Early on, the [Exchange Lab](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/communities/bcdevexchange) recognized that ministries faced several barriers to building digital capacity. It often took months or years to bring in external vendors to support digital initiatives. Further, there was no clear path for existing employees to develop their own digital skills, and ministries struggled to attract and hire talented technologists from outside government.</blockquote>

Legacy policies prevented seamless hiring and this impacted the public. Modernizing takes innovation, of both culture and process. Our team, the Digital Talent Attraction and Development Team (DADT), was one of the responses to these barriers. 

The DTAD are subject matter experts with cross-functional talent from the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and the Public Service Agency (PSA). We contribute to resolutions of the Province’s complex problems by designing services to build internal capacity for digital talent across government. The team partners across multiple program areas across BC Government to tap into multiple subject matter experts on digital talent. 

We work, live, and play on the lands of lək̓ʷəŋən People, now known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations, scəw̓aθən (Tsawwassen), xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) and Coast Salish Peoples, Lheidli T'enneh, and Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc territory. 

The diversity of these lands shapes our team members and impacts the foundation of our hiring services. 

Across Provincial Government from November 2021 – December 2022, we: 

<li>Completed 16 competitions 
<li>Interviewed 175 Candidates 
<li>Had 584 Applicants 
  <ul><li>490 External to B.C. Government</li>
    <li>94 Internal to B.C. Government</ul>

We are passionate about delivering a better service, so the BC Public Service continues and scales employing brilliant workers. Our team currently offers both hiring and consulting services. We work with Hiring Managers to ensure they get the digital talent they need and ensure digital talent is placed in organizations that are ready for agile ways of working.
