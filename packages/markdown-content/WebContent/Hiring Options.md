<h1>Hiring Options in the BC Public Service</h1>

Hiring Managers (HM) have the choice to be supported by the Public Service Agency (PSA) or the Digital Talent Attraction and Development Team (DADT). This depends on which hiring option works for your team. 

There are four different options available:

<li>	Traditional Hiring with the PSA
<li>	RapidHire with the DADT
<li>  Cross-Government Hiring with the DADT
<li>  Hiring Talent from Eligibility Lists

This page provides an overview for Traditional Hiring, Cross-Government Hiring, and Eligibility Lists. This page has more information about RapidHire.

<h2>Option 1:	Traditional Hiring</h2>

Many HMs use traditional hiring and can be creative throughout the process. PSA supports competitions when requested by the HM. Because of many requests throughout B.C. Government, this option takes three weeks. 

<h2>Option 2: Cross-Ministry Hiring Project (CMHP)</h2> 

This options serves many ministries at the same time. HMs can take part in group hiring for digital job profiles, such as an Information Systems 24.

<h2>Option 3: Eligibility Lists</h2> 

An Eligibility List is a list of candidates who interviewed and passed with a high score. Because they did not score the highest, they did not win the competition. 

To save time and resources, HMs can have suitability interviews with the candidates. If the candidate fits the position, they are quickly hired. A candidate stays on the list for six months or one year. We remove them from the list if they decline two job offers.
