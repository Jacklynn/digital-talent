On April 6th, 2023, the Digital Office released B.C. Government’s Digital Plan. One of many items reported on are hiring barriers:

“Early on, the [Exchange Lab](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/communities/bcdevexchange) recognized that ministries faced several barriers to building digital capacity. It often took months or years to bring in external vendors to support digital initiatives. Further, there was no clear path for existing employees to develop their own digital skills, and ministries struggled to attract and hire talented technologists from outside government.”

Legacy policies prevented seamless hiring and this impacted the public. Modernizing takes innovation, of both culture and process. Our team, the Digital Talent Attraction and Development Team (DADT), was one of the responses to these barriers. 

We work, live, and play on the lands of lək̓ʷəŋən People, now known as the Esquimalt and Songhees Nations, scəw̓aθən (Tsawwassen), xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) and Coast Salish Peoples, Lheidli T'enneh, and Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc territory. 

The diversity of these lands shapes our team members and impacts the foundation of our hiring services. We contribute to resolutions of the Province’s complex problems by designing services to build internal capacity for digital talent across government. 

Across Provincial Government from November 2021 – December 2022, we: 

- 	Completed 16 competitions 
- 	Had 584 Applicants 
- 	490 External to B.C. Government
- 	94 Internal to B.C. Government
- 	Interviewed 175 Candidates 

This page hosts more information about hiring options. If any of them apply to the hiring needs in your area, let's connect. 

We want this Province to thrive!
